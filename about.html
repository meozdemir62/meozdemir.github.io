    I'm Merve (pronounced 'mehr-veh'), a cancer researcher living in Boston, Massachusetts.
    I grew up in Istanbul, Turkey, and moved to the US in 2019 for my undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley. </p>

  <p class="centered" style="margin: 20px auto; max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: large;">
    In my free time, I love to read, write, paint, code and learn new languages! üìöüé®üåç </p>

  <h5 class="centered" style="color: #242223; margin: 20px auto; max-width: 800px; font-size: 20px">education</h3>
  <p class="centered" style="margin: 20px auto; max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: large;"> 
    I started my undergraduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2019.
    In my second year, having always had a particular interest in cancer and wanting to learn more about it, I declared a concentration in Immunology   
    and started learning about immune systems, cancer, and how tumors interact with/shape the immune microenvironments surrounding them. </p>
  
  <p class="centered" style="margin: 20px auto; max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: large;"> 
    Though my formal education was heavily biology-focused, in my last semester of college, I took a comprehensive Introduction to Computer Science and Programming course and immediately fell in love with it.
    Having had a taste of what computer science has to offer, I finished college feeling a little sad about my relatively late introduction to the field, 
    yet with the knowledge that it wasn't too late, and curious to learn more. </p>
  
  <h5 class="centered" style="color: #242223; margin: 20px auto; max-width: 800px; font-size: 20px">undergraduate research</h3>
  <p class="centered" style="margin: 20px auto; max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: large;">  
    In my second year of college, I joined the lab of Michel DuPage, where I embarked on my cancer research journey. In the DuPage Lab I worked at the intersection of cancer biology, immunology and epigenetics, to explore ways to selectively reprogram regulatory T cells to enhance anti-tumor immunity while eliminating risk for autoimmune toxicity.
    I wrote and defended my undergraduate honors thesis about the role of EN101, a cysteine-reactive compound, on Foxp3 regulation in Tregs. </p>
  
  <h5 class="centered" style="color: #242223; margin: 20px auto; max-width: 800px; font-size: 20px">work</h3>
  <p class="centered" style="margin: 20px auto; max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: large;"> 
    In 2023, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Molecular & Cell Biology (with a concentration of Immunology)
    and moved to Boston to start working at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
    Here, I joined the lab of Birgit Knoechel, and was introduced to the exciting world of cutting edge single cell sequencing technologies and bioinformatics. </p>

  <p class="centered" style="margin: 20px auto; max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: large;"> 
    Now, I have a lot of experience in single cell RNA-sequencing, particularly in Chromium Single Cell Gene Expression, Cell Surface Protein Expression and TCR/BCR analysis via 10X genomics.
    In addition to scRNA-seq, I also currently work on CAR T-cell therapies with a special focus on preventing resistance.

  <p class="centered" style="margin: 20px auto; max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: large;"> 
    I am interested in continuing my learning journey in graduate school. <br> Thanks for following along! üî¨üë©üèª‚Äçüî¨ </p>
